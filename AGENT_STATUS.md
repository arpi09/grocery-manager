## Coordinator rules

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Push** | Only after: `Approved to push [branch-name]` |
| **Dev runtime** | `dev:watch` in main worktree — no manual restart needed |

## 500 error (resolved)

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Symptom** | HTTP 500 on `/login` and all pages |
| **Root cause** | Uncommitted WIP added `drizzle/0003_household.sql` with non-idempotent `ADD CONSTRAINT`, listed in `PGlite_INCREMENTAL_MIGRATIONS`, and migrations ran **twice** per boot (`openPglite` + `initDatabase`). Every dev restart re-applied constraints → PGlite error `constraint … already exists`. |
| **Fix applied** | Main worktree reset to clean `master` (`62198f5`). No code change required on origin — WIP was the cause. |
| **When restoring household/profile/theme WIP** | Make `0003_household.sql` constraints idempotent (`DO $$ … duplicate_object`) before re-adding to incremental list. |
| **Verify** | `curl http://localhost:5173/login` → **200**; logged-out `/` → **302** `/login` |

## Base branch

| Item | Value |
|------|--------|
| **master / origin/master** | `62198f5` — Går ut snart on home (expiring-soon merged & pushed) |
| **origin/feature/expiring-soon-home** | Same as master (`0` ahead / `0` behind) |

## Stashes (5)

| Stash | Branch context | Summary |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| `stash@{0}` | `feature/analytics-page` | Analytics + partial profile/household merge |
| `stash@{1}` | `feature/user-profile` | Push-all cleanup WIP (inventory/household-related) |
| `stash@{2}` | `feature/user-profile` | all-wip-before-analytics-clean |

## Merge order (recommended)

1. Keep **master** green (current state).
2. **chore/e2e-on-master** — merge to master & push after approval (supersedes `feat/e2e-playwright` on origin).
3. **feature/shared-household** — branch + idempotent migrations + tests.
4. **feature/user-profile** + **feature/profile-dark-theme** (rebase stashes).
5. **feature/analytics-page** from `stash@{0}` / `29ad7a5` content.
6. **docs/agent-coordination** — sync `AGENT_STATUS.md` / `OWNERSHIP.md`.
